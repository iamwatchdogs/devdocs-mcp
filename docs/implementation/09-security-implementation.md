# Security Implementation

Documentation content is an untrusted input channel (research: security-licensing.md §1). The domain is narrow and read-only, which makes the mitigation set tractable. This file maps each mitigation to a module and states the invariants that tests enforce.

## Control map

| Threat (research: security-licensing.md §1) | Control | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Indirect prompt injection through crawled content | Injection filter, quarantine-on-flag | devdocs-ingest |
| Corpus poisoning (PoisonedRAG class) | License gate + deny-by-default registry + operator-controlled sources | devdocs-ingest |
| Registry metadata poisoning | Config is local and operator-owned. No remote registries in v1 | devdocs-model |
| SSRF, DNS rebinding, redirects | Fetch guard (below) | devdocs-ingest |
| Parser attacks (XML entities, YAML tags, `$ref` cycles) | oas3 parser limits, serde_yaml_ng safe loading, cycle detection with warnings | devdocs-ingest |
| Git hook / filter execution during clone | Clone with hooks and filters disabled (below) | devdocs-ingest |
| Secret leakage through docs | Redaction pass at ingest and output | devdocs-ingest, devdocs |
| Read-only scope breach | The tool never writes outside `DEVDOCS_HOME` and temp dirs. No shell execution of fetched content | whole binary |

## Read-only and data-not-instructions

- The tool never executes fetched content. Code examples render as data. No auto-run, no shell-out with doc content, ever (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 5).
- Retrieved text is data. The MCP envelope marks it: results are content, and the server instructions tell the model that doc text cannot change tool policy. The CLI result envelope includes no model-facing directives at all (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 2).
- ANSI and control sequences are stripped from chunk text at ingest. Terminal output re-escapes anything that looks like an escape sequence (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 3).

## Fetch guard invariants

The guard is the only network code. Enforced properties, each with a property test ([04](04-testing-strategy.md)):

1. Scheme is HTTPS. Everything else fails before DNS.
2. URL has no userinfo. URL normalizes through the `url` crate before checks.
3. DNS resolves through the pinned resolver. The connection opens only to the resolved address, with SNI intact (reqwest 0.13 `dns_resolver` hook, verified 2026-10-28).
4. The resolved IP passes the blocklist check at connect time: private, loopback, link-local, multicast, unspecified, documentation (`2001:db8::/32`, `192.0.2.0/24`, `198.51.100.0/24`, `203.0.113.0/24`), and cloud metadata ranges (`169.254.169.254/32` and equivalents).
5. Redirects re-run checks 1 to 4 on every hop. Limit 3.
6. Byte cap 20 MiB applies to decompressed bytes, enforced by a wrapping reader, not by trusting Content-Length.
7. Timeout 15 s per request. Total ingest job wall time caps at 600 s by config.
8. Fail closed: any guard error aborts the whole source ingest, not just the failing request.

The pinned resolver returns one address per host lookup. DNS rebinding fails because the connect-time IP is the checked IP.

## Git subprocess safety

- argv arrays only. No shell, no string concatenation into commands.
- `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` on every invocation.
- Clone with hooks and filters disabled: `git clone --config core.hooksPath=/dev/null --config filter.lfs.process= --filter=blob:none` where supported, and a docs-only sparse checkout for large repos. A malicious repo cannot run checkout hooks through this path.
- Remote URLs come from config or CLI, never from fetched content. A source URL that changes between plan and fetch aborts the run.
- The temp clone directory sits under `DEVDOCS_HOME/tmp` with mode 0700 and is removed after the run.

## Injection filter operations

The filter flags. It does not silently rewrite (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 3. [07](07-ingest-pipeline.md) carries the rule table):

- Quarantined chunks store a `quarantine` flag and stay out of all serving paths. The exclusion is a store-layer guarantee, not a query-layer filter.
- `devdocs db quarantine list` shows flagged chunks with rule names. `devdocs db quarantine release <chunk_id>` moves the chunk back after operator review, with an audit line in `meta`.
- Rule recall beats precision in v0. A false positive costs one manual review. A false negative costs one poisoned context. Tune toward recall, log everything.

## Secrets and redaction

- A redaction pass runs at ingest over chunk text: common token shapes (`ghp_…`, `sk-…`, AWS key shapes, PEM blocks, Bearer headers) are replaced with `[REDACTED:<kind>]` before persistence.
- The same pass runs over output rendering as a second gate.
- Logs carry provenance, not user queries (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 8). `--verbose` prints queries locally. Nothing leaves the machine in v1 because there is no telemetry.

## Local storage controls

From the research local-profile controls (research: security-licensing.md §2):

- `DEVDOCS_HOME` created with mode 0700. `docs.db` with 0600. The store verifies modes at open and warns on drift.
- Symlink check: the store refuses a DB path that is a symlink into another user's territory (ownership check on the resolved path).
- Secure temp cleanup: `tmp/` contents removed on process exit, including the SIGINT/SIGTERM path.
- Network filesystems: the store refuses a DB path on a known network mount prefix (for example `/net/`, SMB mountpoints) unless `--allow-network-fs` is set, because SQLite locking over network FS is unreliable.

## License gate enforcement points

The state machine is defined in [07](07-ingest-pipeline.md). Enforcement is layered so a bug in one place cannot serve a denied source:

1. The ingest planner refuses sources below `approved_fetch`.
2. The store refuses to flip a source to `active` below `approved_index`.
3. The retrieve layer filters on license state at query time. A source revoked after indexing drops out of results at the next query, not just at the next sync.
4. Output rendering enforces the snippet-vs-full rule per source state.

## Code Mode sandbox (deferred)

Code Mode ships only after the full sandbox contract passes (research: security-licensing.md §4): fail-closed feature detection, rootless process with seccomp and namespaces, brokered capability tokens, network disabled by default, hard resource limits, redacted telemetry, kill switch. The core exposes no code-mode surface today. Any future work starts from that contract as acceptance criteria, not as hardening TODOs.

## Security checklist for releases

Run before each tagged release:

1. `cargo audit` clean, or every advisory triaged with a note.
2. `cargo deny check` passes with the allow lists.
3. The fetch-guard property tests pass on all targets.
4. No new dependency entered the tree without the checklist in [10](10-dependency-audit.md).
5. The injection-filter rule set has a review note in the release PR: rules added, removed, or tuned.
6. `grep -r "unwrap(" crates/ --include="*.rs" -l` returns only test files (the lint denies it. Verify manually).
7. The release binary runs the CLI end-to-end suite from a clean `DEVDOCS_HOME` in a temp dir.
