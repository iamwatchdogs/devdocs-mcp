# Ingest Pipeline (L1 + L2)

## Priority ladder

The adapter picker tries source types in this order (research: architecture.md §L1):

1. `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` at the docs root. Publisher-sanctioned. Markdown or linkable pages.
2. Git repository clone pinned to a tag or commit. Version-exact and reproducible.
3. OpenAPI specification. Structured, high-signal for API surface.
4. HTML crawl. Last resort only, gated harder than the others.

The user can force a kind with `--kind llms_txt|git|openapi|html`. Auto-detection order: an explicit `--kind` wins. Then the config `[sources]` entry. Then probes in ladder order. A probe is a bounded HEAD or GET with the fetch guard active.

## Adapter trait

All adapters implement one trait in `devdocs-ingest`:

```rust
pub trait IngestAdapter {
    fn kind(&self) -> SourceKind;
    /// Probe the source and produce an ingest plan without fetching bodies.
    fn plan(&self, ctx: &IngestContext) -> Result<IngestPlan, IngestError>;
    /// Fetch raw documents per the plan. Emits progress events.
    fn fetch(&self, ctx: &IngestContext, plan: IngestPlan) -> Result<Vec<RawDocument>, IngestError>;
}

pub struct RawDocument {
    pub path: String,        // logical path, e.g. "docs/proxy.mdx"
    pub body: DocumentBody,  // Text(Markdown|Html|Json|Yaml) with media hints
    pub provenance: Provenance,
}

pub struct Provenance {
    pub origin_url: String,
    pub commit_sha: Option<String>,
    pub fetched_at: OffsetDateTime,
    pub etag: Option<String>,
}
```

`fetch` streams through the fetch guard. It never opens a connection outside the guard.

## llms.txt adapter (v2)

The spec is llmstxt.org v2 (verified 2026-10-28. Updated August 2026). Parse rules:

1. Fetch `/llms.txt` at the docs root. Parse the H1 (library title), the blockquote (summary), and the H2 sections of links. The H1 must carry a title: an empty one fails the parse as `LLMS_TXT_INVALID`.
2. Each link line is `- [title](url): description`. The optional parenthesized info carries per-page hints. V2 link relations (`rel="alternate" type="text/markdown"`, `rel="describedby"`) mark markdown twins. Prefer a `.md` twin over its HTML page.
3. If `/llms-full.txt` exists, fetch it and treat it as one pre-built export. The research bundle treats llms-full as the bulk feed (research: interfaces.md §6). It is an unofficial convention, so detection is a probe, not an assumption.
4. v2 subpath scoping: a more specific `llms.txt` deeper in the tree applies to that subtree. The plan walks links breadth-first and uses the most specific index found per path.
5. Quality gate: an index with zero links (the documented ADK failure, research: interfaces.md §6) fails the plan with `LLMS_TXT_EMPTY` and the picker falls to the next rung.

Implemented shape (M3b): the rules above land as follows.

- **Page shapes.** An index link is a page when its path ends in `.md`, `.mdx`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`, or carries no extension at all (directory-style URLs). `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` are never pages.
- **Link relations.** The relations arrive three ways: the parenthesized per-page hints of a link line (`- [Page](url) (rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" twin-url): notes`), the page response's `Link:` headers (an RFC 8288 subset), and `<link>` elements scanned from an HTML body. A response relation wins over the index hint.
- **Twin preference.** An HTML page with a markdown twin ingests the twin (a markdown-twin event counts it). A page without a twin falls back to its HTML path; the media split skips it, because no HTML extractor exists in this slice. The same page never buffers twice: routes and twins dedup by URL, and the corpus dedup collapses equal bodies.
- **Subpath scoping.** The walk is a FIFO queue of scopes: a link naming an `llms.txt` opens a deeper scope, a page's `rel="describedby"` response can open one, and the queue drains breadth-first. A page ingests under the scope with the longest directory path prefix — the most specific index wins; a page listed by a shallower scope defers to the deeper scope's turn. A page the shallower turn already buffered is re-fetched at that turn, and the deeper listing's document — with its own twin hints — replaces the buffered one in place, so the corpus keeps one document per page and the most specific listing governs it. Each scope joins its links against the redirect-aware base its index response came from.
- **llms-full probe.** Every scope probes `llms-full.txt` at its directory. Absence is an expected outcome: a 404 or 410 on the wire, a missing replay response, or a non-UTF-8 body all read as "not there"; every other fetch error still fails the run and the guard policy still applies. When present, the export is one pre-built document that joins the corpus and is segmented like any other markdown body.
- **Ingest events.** The run reports pages, skipped pages, skipped blocks (content-less blocks), unknown fence languages (a named language outside the known set; unnamed fences never count), unsupported fence languages (a symbol-capable language whose grammar feature is off, including the `typescript`, `ts`, and `tsx` aliases), chrome pattern drops, chrome drops (frequency-rule drops), dedup dropped pages, markdown twins used, subpath indexes, and llms-full exports. The counts surface as stderr log lines under `--verbose` and as the `events` object of the `--json` add envelope; they carry provenance only, never chunk text.
- **Page URL.** Each ingested page stores its URL in `chunks.page_url`; the twin's URL stores when a twin ingests. Git-repo chunks carry NULL.

## Git adapter

Clone and checkout shell out to the system `git` binary. This matches cargo, uv, and gh (verified 2026-10-28). Rules:

- Never pass arguments through a shell. Build an argv vector. No string interpolation into a command line.
- Set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so private repos fail fast instead of hanging.
- Set `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`. Do not read the user's global git config for clones; this also suppresses credential helpers.
- Tag pin: fetch the tag ref only — `git init <dir>`, `git fetch --depth 1 --filter=blob:none <url> +refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>`, `git checkout --detach refs/tags/<tag>^{commit}`. The tag-only refspec keeps a branch of the same spelling from winning the name collision. A non-SHA pin must name an exact tag; branch names are rejected — a mutable ref is not a reproducible pin.
- Commit pin: shallow clone the default branch, then `git fetch --depth 1 origin <sha>` and `git checkout --detach <sha>`. If the server rejects a reachable-SHA fetch, fall back to a full clone. Record the fallback in the ingest event log.
- Extract docs content with the `ignore` crate walk (respects `.gitignore`) filtered by an extension allowlist: `md, mdx, rst, adoc, txt, json, yaml, yml`. The config can extend the list.
- Record `commit_sha` from `git rev-parse HEAD` in the temp clone. It becomes the provenance commit for every chunk of that source.

Implemented shape (M6): the rules above land as follows.

- **Module.** `devdocs-ingest::git` exposes `plan` → `GitPlan`, `GitPlan::fetch` → `GitFetch`, and the `TempClone` guard; the adapter is synchronous and the ingest pipeline wraps it in `spawn_blocking`.
- **Plan.** `plan(url, pin, data_root)` validates the pin, classifies it (exactly 40 hex characters, case-insensitive, normalized lowercase → commit; anything else → tag), and creates the private clone directory. The plan first checks the system git once per process: the adapter requires Git 2.32 or later, and an older git fails the ingest as `GIT_TOO_OLD`, because `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` is ignored before 2.32 and the global-config pin no-ops ([09](09-security-implementation.md) §Git subprocess safety). A pin starting with `-` fails as `GIT_INVALID_PIN` before any git invocation. The plan carries the URL as the single source of truth; a fetch whose URL differs from the planned one fails as `GIT_URL_MISMATCH`.
- **Command layer.** One builder runs every invocation: `Command::new("git")` with an argv vector only — no shell, no interpolated command line. The child env strips the ambient `GIT_*` location and control variables (the full list lives in `devdocs-ingest::git`), pins `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, and after the strip pins the ssh transport noninteractive (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND=ssh -oBatchMode=yes`) — the full pin set lives in [09](09-security-implementation.md) §Git subprocess safety. Per-command config: `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, the LFS filters blanked, and `protocol.file.allow=user`. A missing binary maps to `GIT_BINARY_MISSING`; a non-zero exit carries a bounded stderr tail (at most the last 512 bytes) for display, and the error also keeps the complete stderr for refusal classification. Every invocation is waited on with a bounded loop up to a per-invocation deadline set at the total-cap duration; at expiry the git child is killed and reaped instead of orphaning the clone's network I/O, and the run fails as `GIT_TIMEOUT`. The run-wide cap stays the pipeline timeout ([09](09-security-implementation.md) §Git subprocess safety).
- **Fetch.** Tag pins fetch shallowly and unambiguously: the adapter runs `git init <dir>`, then `fetch --depth 1 --filter=blob:none <url> +refs/tags/<pin>:refs/tags/<pin>`, then `checkout --detach refs/tags/<pin>^{commit}`. `clone --branch` resolves a branch before a tag when both spellings exist, so the refspec names `refs/tags` only and the fetch verifies the pin with `git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/tags/<pin>^{commit}`; a pin that names no tag — git reports `couldn't find remote ref` — fails as the `GIT_PIN_NOT_TAG` usage error, while operational failures (spawn, timeout, transport) keep their own errors — non-SHA pins are tag-only. Commit pins clone the default branch shallowly (with `--filter=blob:none`), then `fetch --depth 1 origin <sha>`, then `checkout --detach <sha>`; when the SHA fetch fails — a server without `allowReachableSHA1InWant` — the fetch falls back to a full clone (no `--depth`, no `--filter`) and reports `fallback_used: true` to the caller. `commit_sha` comes from `git rev-parse HEAD` and must be 40 hex (`GIT_COMMIT_SHA_INVALID` otherwise). A docs-only sparse checkout is deferred: `--filter=blob:none` keeps blobs out of the clone pack, but the checkout that follows fetches the blob of every file it materializes, document or not, and the docs walk filters content after checkout — it does not bound the transfer or checkout size. The deviation is revisited when a real repository requires it ([09](09-security-implementation.md) §Git subprocess safety).
- **Docs walk.** The `ignore` walker runs with `require_git(true)` and `follow_links(false)`, so the clone's `.gitignore` rules apply. Host-level ignore sources are excluded for pin determinism: `parents(false)`, `git_global(false)`, and `git_exclude(false)` keep a parent-directory `.ignore`, the operator's global `core.excludesFile`, and `.git/info/exclude` out of the walk, so only the clone's own in-tree `.gitignore` and `.ignore` rules apply. The extension allowlist (config `ingest.git_extensions`) filters in the walk loop, not through an override whitelist: the `ignore` crate gives overrides the highest precedence, so an override would re-admit `.gitignore`d files whose extension is allowlisted. The walker keeps the `ignore` default of skipping hidden entries, so dot paths like `.github/` or `.config/mkdocs.yml` never reach the allowlist. Files that fail to read as UTF-8 are skipped and counted. A file read that fails at the I/O level fails the walk as `GIT_WALK_FAILED`; only decode failures are skipped. The walk yields the pipeline's `PageDocument` shape (path relative to the clone root), so the git corpus enters the same dedup/chrome/segment stages as the llms.txt corpus.
- **Temp dir and cleanup.** The clone lives under `<data_root>/tmp/devdocs-git-<random>`, both directories created with mode 0700 and verified. The `TempClone` guard removes the directory on drop and registers its path in a one-slot process registry; the SIGINT/SIGTERM handler (installed once, idempotently, when the first temp dir is created) removes the registered path and exits 130. A best-effort sweep at the next `TempClone::create` removes `devdocs-git-*` entries whose mtime is older than the total cap, while young entries survive, so a concurrent run's live clone is never swept. On a live run the per-invocation deadline kills and reaps the git child, the blocked `spawn_blocking` closure then finishes, the guard drops, and the dir is removed. The total cap can end the run first: each invocation's deadline starts at that invocation, so it can run past the total cap — that drift is why the shutdown flag exists. On that path the CLI returns `TotalTimeout` and sets the git shutdown flag before it exits; the command wait loop kills and reaps the in-flight child at the next poll, and the runtime keeps a 5 s shutdown grace, so the blocked closure finishes, the guard drops, and the dir is removed before the process exits. A SIGTERM delivered to the CLI alone (not the terminal's process group) removes the clone dir while git runs briefly; git fails on the missing paths and exits. The sweep stays the best-effort backstop for both paths.
- **Pipeline entry.** `IngestJob::run_git` runs the git path: the same deny-by-default license gate and registry-name check as the llms.txt entry, then `plan` → `fetch` inside one `spawn_blocking` under the total cap, then the shared dedup/chrome/segment corpus path, and `publish_generation` after the cap. The plan and the fetch receive the same URL string, so the adapter's `GIT_URL_MISMATCH` check holds by construction. The source row publishes as `kind: git` with `commit_sha` from `rev-parse HEAD`; a corpus with zero allowlisted files fails with the shared `NoIngestablePages` refusal and publishes nothing. `fallback_used` counts into the `sha_fetch_fallbacks` ingest event. Extra per-command git config (the protocol-version seam tests force) enters through `IngestJob::with_extra_git_config`.

## OpenAPI adapter

- Parse with the `oas3` crate (0.22.0, verified active 2026-10-28).
- Emit one chunk per operation: method + path as the symbol (`GET /v1/files`), summary as the title, description, parameters table, and the first request/response example. The API-specification-alone evidence supports signature-first chunks (research: retrieval-design.md §1, CloudAPIBench ablation).
- Emit one chunk per schema object with its properties. Symbols take the schema name.
- `$ref` cycles produce a warning and a skipped chunk, never a hang.

## HTML adapter (last resort)

- Pre-strip with `lol_html` (3.0.2): remove `script`, `style`, `noscript`, `iframe`, `svg`, nav and footer containers by common selectors.
- Extract main content with `dom_smoothie` (0.19.0) in Markdown output mode. On extraction failure or empty output, fall back to `rust-trafilatura` (2.2.8). Record which extractor produced each chunk.
- Check robots.txt before crawling more than one page of a host. Parse it with a minimal internal parser (the `texting_robots` crate is dormant since 2023, verified 2026-10-28. Vendor its grammar or implement the small subset: user-agent groups, allow, disallow, crawl-delay, sitemap). A disallow for the user agent blocks the source at the license gate level with status `denied`.
- Crawl depth defaults to 2, page cap 200, same-host only. These are config floors. A source may lower them.

## Fetch guard

The fetch guard is the only network code in the tool. Design from the research egress discipline (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 10). Full invariants and tests live in [09](09-security-implementation.md). Summary:

1. HTTPS only. Reject other schemes, userinfo in URLs, and non-HTTP(S) ports.
2. Resolve DNS, then connect only to the resolved IP. Re-check the target IP against the blocklist at connect time, for every redirect hop.
3. Blocklist: private, loopback, link-local, multicast, unspecified, documentation ranges, and cloud metadata endpoints.
4. Redirect limit 3 (config `max_redirects`). Each hop re-validates the scheme, host resolution, and IP.
5. Response cap 20 MiB (config `max_bytes`), enforced on decompressed bytes. Timeout 15 s per request (config `timeout_ms`).
6. User agent from config. Identify honestly as `devdocs/VERSION`.

Implementation: reqwest 0.13 with `dns_resolver(Arc<dyn Resolve>)`. The custom resolver returns one pinned address per lookup, and a connect-time hook re-validates it. reqwest 0.13 keeps this hook (verified 2026-10-28: `dns_resolver<R: IntoResolve>`). The crypto default is aws-lc-rs under rustls, so no OpenSSL link.

## License gate

The gate runs before any fetch, embed, or serve decision for a source (research: security-licensing.md §3). Deny by default: a source with no registry entry is `pending_review` and cannot fetch. The library name a run publishes under is the registry entry: `IngestJob::run` refuses a library argument that does not match the grant's `[sources.<name>]` key.

The SQLite store is authoritative for the mutable license state: `sources.license_status`, `sources.license_expires_at`, and the audit lines in `meta` (docs/implementation/06 §License-gate state). The config entry `[sources.<name>]` stays declarative for `url`, the license SPDX id, and the optional `attribution` line. The optional `expires` line is the enforced default: a fresh library's first publish stamps it into the store row. A config entry that carries `status` fails validation with the key path `sources.<name>.status` (docs/implementation/05 §Configuration).

The first sync of a registered source with no store row grants the index stage. Recording the `[sources.<name>]` entry is the operator's approval decision. The gate parses the `expires` line before it grants. A configured date that has already passed refuses the sync with `FETCH_BLOCKED` and names the `sources.<name>.expires` key — on the first sync, and on any sync where a row of the library records no date the publish would fill. A future date rides the grant to the publish, which seeds it into the row. With rows present and every row already recording a date, the store stays authoritative: the sweep handles the recorded date, and the inert config date cannot seed.

State machine:

```text
pending_review → approved_fetch → approved_index → approved_embed
               → approved_cache → approved_snippet
terminal: denied | expired | revoked
```

| Transition | Requires |
|---|---|
| pending_review → approved_fetch | Publisher identity recorded, license recorded (SPDX or `unknown`), robots and ToS note recorded |
| approved_fetch → approved_index | A human confirms indexing rights for the recorded license |
| approved_index → approved_embed | Rights for derivative embeddings (usually same as index) |
| any → denied | Operator decision, robots disallow, or ToS conflict |
| any → expired / revoked | Takedown contact fires, or the recorded expiry passes |
| denied → pending_review | Operator-only decision. The sole exit from a refusal. Requires a non-empty note |

`expired` and `revoked` are absorbing: no transition leaves them. The store runs the state check, the state update, and the audit line in one transaction, so an illegal move leaves no trace. A withdrawal (docs/implementation/09 §License gate enforcement points) runs in one transaction too, and it appends one audit line with the operator `auto:withdraw` for each row whose status actually changes.

Runtime consequences per state:

| State | Query hit | Verbatim text | Full-document render |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pending_review` | No indexed content to hit | No | No |
| `approved_fetch` … `approved_cache` | Yes, metadata only | No | No |
| `approved_snippet` | Yes | Yes, spans within the token budget | No |
| `denied`, `expired`, `revoked` | `search` drops them silently; a direct-name query and `open` answer `NOT_AVAILABLE`, exit 2, `miss_reason: license_blocked`, hint `run: devdocs source list` | No | No |

No state grants a full-document render. `open` serves spans within the token budget only. Only `approved_snippet` serves verbatim text; the approved states below it stay queryable but serve no verbatim text.

### Expiry sweep

`sources.license_expires_at` records the lapse date (migration 0004, docs/implementation/06). Every read path and the sync gate runs the sweep first: a row whose recorded expiry has passed and which does not already sit in a terminal refusal flips to `expired`, and the sweep appends one audit line with the operator `auto:expiry`. A row without an expiry never flips. A published row inherits the library's latest stored expiry date. A fresh library takes the date from the configured `expires` line. The sweep lapses the recorded date without an operator action. Rows already `denied`, `expired`, or `revoked` stay put. The boundary is 00:00 UTC of the recorded expiry date: the stored date-only value compares string-wise against the full RFC 3339 instant, so a row flips on the recorded date itself.

### Registry commands

```text
devdocs source approve <library> <stage> [--note N] [--operator O] [--expires D]
devdocs source deny <library> [--note N] [--operator O]
devdocs source list
```

`approve` moves the library's rows to `stage` and stamps the operator and the instant on the audit line. `--expires` records the lapse date the sweep enforces. `--expires` overwrites a date the publish seeded from the config. The publish seed never clobbers an operator date. A later-published version row inherits the library's latest stored date, so the operator extension holds. `deny` records the refusal. `source list` runs the sweep first, so the printed states reflect passed expiries. `denied → pending_review` requires `--note`.

Every transition appends one audit line to `meta`. The key is `audit:<rfc3339 nanosecond timestamp>`; a same-instant collision takes a `-<n>` suffix. The value is `(audit:<ts>, library, from, to, operator[, note])`. `from` joins the distinct row states with `|` when the library's rows disagree.

Attribution: the operator records the `attribution` line on the config entry. `open` joins it into `ResultItem.attribution` — the MCP seam — and prints it in human output (docs/implementation/05 §Configuration).

## Normalization pipeline

Order matters. Each stage is a pure function over `RawDocument` streams, so snapshots test it deterministically.

1. **Media split.** JSON/YAML documents route to the OpenAPI-shaped path. Markdown routes to segmentation. HTML routes through the HTML extractor first, which emits Markdown. In this slice the HTML extractor does not exist yet: the ingest loop skips a link whose body starts with a doctype or an `html` tag (case-insensitive, after leading whitespace and a leading BOM), and counts it as skipped. This check looks only at the start of the body. A body that starts with an HTML comment or an XML declaration is not skipped, and HTML inside markdown is not removed, so markup can reach the chunks.
2. **Dedup.** Exact by SHA-256 across the corpus. Near-dup (cosine over embeddings) is phase 3, feature-gated. Implemented (M3b): the dedup runs at page granularity before the chrome strip, so a duplicate page cannot skew the frequency counts; the hash is the store's canonical hash (CRLF folds to LF), and the dropped count lands in the ingest events.
3. **Chrome strip.** For HTML: the adapter extracts main content before this stage. For Markdown: strip leading site navigation blocks, "edit this page" links, cookie banners, and repeated boilerplate detected by exact-match frequency across the source (a block identical in more than 60% of pages is chrome, except headings). Implemented (M3b): the corpus buffers first, so the strip runs over the whole source; the pattern rules match link-only blocks before the first heading (leading navigation), short edit-link phrasing, and short cookie banners (a cookie mention that also carries a link or the accept/consent call to action); the frequency rule counts distinct pages, not occurrences, and needs at least two pages. A dropped block collapses with the whitespace runs around it, so kept bytes survive byte-exactly and the chunks reassemble the stripped body. Pattern drops report as chrome pattern drops, frequency drops as chrome drops, and the segmenter reports its content-less skips as skipped blocks.
4. **Segmentation.** Algorithm below.
5. **Contextual headers.** Prepend the breadcrumb and version to every chunk body: `[{library} {version} › {section path}]` (research: architecture.md §L2. Measured effect −49% retrieval failures, −67% with reranking).
6. **Symbol extraction.** Tree-sitter pass over fenced code blocks (per grammar) plus structured sources (OpenAPI operations, front-matter routes). Populates `chunks.symbol` and `symbols`.

   Implemented shape (M5, fences only):

   - **Grammars are features.** `devdocs-ingest` carries per-grammar features `grammar-rust`, `grammar-go`, `grammar-python`, and `grammar-javascript`; the aggregate feature `symbols` (all four) is default-on. tree-sitter core is a required dependency; a grammar crate is optional. TypeScript is deliberately absent ([01](01-tech-stack-decision.md)). A build with grammars disabled extracts nothing and still ingests.
   - **The pass runs during segmentation.** Every prepared chunk carries its extracted symbols. A fence body is parsed with the language its fence-info string names: the first token up to whitespace or a comma, so `rust,ignore` names `rust`. Fences at any depth count — one nested in a list item or a blockquote extracts against the chunk its container block packs into, and its unnamed status or unknown language counts the same way a top-level fence's does. A chunk with no fenced code carries no symbols.
   - **Public shape.** `ExtractedSymbol { name, kind, line }`; `extract(lang, code) -> Vec<ExtractedSymbol>`; `grammar_for(lang) -> Option<Language>`. The kind vocabulary and the per-grammar node kinds are the data-model contract ([06](06-data-model.md) §Symbol columns).
   - **Parse failures never fail the source.** A parse with error nodes still yields the definitions it found; the walk stays defensive. A skipped fence is a counted event, not an error.
   - **Counters.** A named fence language outside the known set counts `unknown_fence_languages`. A symbol-capable language with no enabled grammar — including the `typescript`, `ts`, and `tsx` aliases — counts `unsupported_fence_languages`. Unnamed fences count in neither. Both flow into the `--json` add envelope.
   - **Structured sources stay unimplemented.** The OpenAPI and front-matter half of this step is not built in M5; fences are the only symbol source for now.
7. **Injection filter.** Rules below. Quarantine, never silent edit: a flagged chunk is stored with a quarantine flag and excluded from serving until reviewed.
8. **Publish.** Atomic write, below.

## Segmentation algorithm

Goal: chunk shape with heading, breadcrumb, signature, example, and explanation together. Never split a code block (research: retrieval-design.md §3.2).

1. Parse the Markdown with comrak (0.59.0) and read `sourcepos` for every block node. comrak's code-block source positions are reliable at 0.59 (verified 2026-10-28, sourcepos fixes landed through 0.50).
2. Walk the block tree. Build sections at heading boundaries (ATX headings). A section keeps its nested content and its breadcrumb path.
3. Inside a section, pack blocks into chunks up to the 400-token target (separator bytes between packed blocks join the budget). A block between the target and 2× the target splits with text-splitter (`MarkdownSplitter`, overlap 80 tokens — the research reference engine shape, research: retrieval-design.md §3.2). The splitter treats code blocks as atomic units, so it never splits them; a fenced block is never handed to the splitter at all. Section boundaries and packed block boundaries carry no overlap: both sides of the boundary stay whole, so no content is cut.
4. Cross-check with sourcepos: if a chunk boundary would fall inside a fenced block (the splitter guarantees it does not, but the check catches regressions), merge the two candidate chunks and log a warning.
5. A single block larger than 2× the target becomes its own chunk, never truncated.
6. Token counts use the chars-per-4 heuristic by default. With feature `exact-tokens`, tiktoken o200k. The count is stored per chunk. Budget enforcement uses stored counts and never recounts at query time.

## Injection filter (v0)

Scope: flag, quarantine, and report. Do not attempt language-model detection in v0. The rules are cheap and auditable (research: security-licensing.md §2 item 3).

| Rule | Action |
|---|---|
| Directives addressed to a model ("ignore previous instructions", "disregard your rules", "system prompt") in text outside code blocks | quarantine |
| Instructions that request action ("visit", "download", "run", "curl this", exfiltration verbs) outside code blocks | quarantine |
| Hidden text: HTML comments larger than 2k chars, zero-width-heavy spans, text-colored-on-text patterns (pre-strip leftovers) | quarantine |
| A fenced code block whose info string or first line is a shell command that writes outside the workspace (`curl | sh`, `rm -rf`, `git push --force`) | keep, annotate result with `code_caution: true` |
| Link-to-text ratio above 0.5 in a chunk | flag for review, serve with `confidence` penalty |

Quarantined chunks are visible with `devdocs db quarantine list` and can be released by an operator flag. The tool never serves a quarantined chunk.

## Atomic publish

An ingest run writes nothing visible until it succeeds:

1. Compute all chunks in memory (or spill to `tmp/` for very large sources). A run that segments to zero chunks fails closed before this step: it never replaces the active generation with an empty one.
2. In one SQLite transaction: deactivate the old chunk set for the source, insert the new chunks, symbols, and FTS rows (triggers fire), update the source row (`fetched_at`, `commit_sha`, `active = 1`, and the `license_expires_at` seed — a new version row inherits the library's latest stored date, a fresh library takes the configured date, and an operator date wins). The transaction re-checks the stored license state first: a terminal stored state (`denied`, `expired`, `revoked`) on any row of the library deactivates every row of the library (case-insensitive on the library name) and the publish refuses, so a revocation that lands while a re-sync is in flight wins over the stale record (docs/implementation/09 §License gate enforcement points). A stored `pending_review` also refuses the publish, and the refusal writes nothing: the operator's reopen decision stands. A stored below-index state on the published row itself refuses the same way, checked row-scoped against the upsert key: a stale record must not lift an operator's lower-tier grant. A new version row lands at the library's current least-privileged stored state, read inside the transaction, instead of the record's gate-time snapshot — a record that was in flight while the operator advanced the library cannot strand the new row below it. The publish also rechecks the configured expiry seed before it lands: a configured date that has already passed refuses when the library records no date at all, and any recorded date keeps the config date inert.
3. On any other error: rollback. The old generation stays active and queryable. The license refusal is the exception: it commits the deactivation before returning the error, so a rollback cannot resurrect the terminal rows.
4. Vacuum is manual: `devdocs db vacuum` after large replacements.

## Refresh policy

Velocity-stratified, config-driven (research: architecture.md §L1). Defaults:

| Source class | refresh_days default | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Core stack libraries (in project lockfiles) | 2 | scheduled + on-demand (`devdocs sync`) |
| Actively queried, not in lockfiles | 7 | scheduled |
| Everything else | 30 | on demand only |

- `devdocs sync` checks all approved sources against `refresh_days`, respects ETag/If-None-Match for HTTP sources, and skips anything unchanged by hash.
- Never refresh a source whose stored license state is below `approved_fetch`. The sync gate reads the store authority and runs the expiry sweep first. A terminal state (`denied`, `expired`, `revoked`) blocks sync; terminal sources emit `not_available` on direct queries and drop from search (docs/implementation/07 §License gate).
- Every response carries `fetched_at`, so staleness is visible at answer time (research: architecture.md, risk table).
