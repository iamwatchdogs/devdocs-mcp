# Roadmap and Milestones

## Phases

The phase gates come from the research bundle (research: architecture.md, roadmap table). A phase starts only after the previous gate passes. No gate has run yet. The eval harness in [14](14-benchmark-eval.md) runs them.

| Phase | Weeks | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Measure | 1 | Harness probe: schema rent and per-query cost of the current docs workflow. Eval scaffold | Baseline cost per query recorded. Pilot set of 20 questions curated |
| 1 — Core | 2–4 | `devdocs` CLI + SQLite FTS5 + symbol index over llms.txt and git ingest for ~50 libraries. Version pinning. JSON + citations + hashes. Skill file | Symbol recall ≥ 95% on the golden set. hit@5 ≥ 0.8. p95 < 400 ms. $0 schema. An agent completes doc tasks through the CLI alone |
| 2 — Quality | 5–8 | Contextual headers (already in), dedup, injection filter, trust and freshness metadata, MCP shim, license registry | Retrieval failures −49% versus Phase 1 baseline. MCP and CLI produce identical results for the same query |
| 3 — Scale | 9–12 | Optional embedding hybrid with RRF. Sync jobs. Benchmark run per the research protocol | Hybrid improves hit@3 without breaking the latency gate. CLI+local cost ≤ $0.20 per 1,000 queries at frontier pricing (the model in research: interfaces.md §1). Protocol gates PASS |
| 4 — Optional Code Mode | 13+ | Sandbox per the research contract. Typed facade | Sandbox escape and exfiltration suite passes. Code mode wins cost or p95 on multi-hop tasks with no security regression |

## Milestones

Effort is in focused working days for one engineer.

| ID | Milestone | Scope | Acceptance criteria | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repository scaffold | [02](02-project-scaffolding.md) complete. CI green on an empty workspace | `just ci` passes in CI. All lint gates active | 1 d |
| M1 | CLI skeleton | clap commands, exit codes 0/1/2/3/4, JSON errors, non-TTY rules, config load | `crates/devdocs/tests` covers every error code. `devdocs --help` fits one screen | 2 d |
| M2 | Store layer | Schema 0001, migrations runner, FTS5 verified, WAL, store API | Migration up/down tests. FTS5 behavior tests (bm25 weights, snippet, tokenizer) | 2 d |
| M3 | llms.txt ingest E2E | Fetch guard, license gate (deny by default), llms.txt v2 adapter, chrome strip, segmentation, publish | Add 3 real libraries offline-safe (fixture replay). Snapshots stable. Guard property tests pass | 4 d |
| M4 | Search + result shape | Resolve, FTS5 rung, fusion placeholder (single rung), budget pack, result envelope, `open`, `verify` | `--json` snapshots fixed. Exit 2 path with `miss_reason`. Budget tests | 3 d |
| M5 | Symbol index | tree-sitter pass over code fences for rust, go, python, javascript. `symbols` table. `devdocs symbol` | Symbol recall ≥ 95% on the pilot golden set (the Phase 1 gate, partial) | 3 d |
| M6 | Git adapter | Shell-out clone, pinned tag/commit, docs-only walk, commit provenance | Fixture-repo tests. Pinned-SHA fallback path tested. No-network CI stays green | 3 d |
| M7 | License gate full | State machine transitions, audit lines, `source approve`, runtime enforcement at all four points | Transition table tests. Revoked-source drop-at-query test | 2 d |
| M8 | MCP adapter | rmcp server, 3 tools, annotations, instructions, contract tests vs CLI | Identical-results gate passes on a 50-query corpus sample | 2 d |
| M9 | Packaging | Release matrix, checksums, trusted publishing, README, CONTRIBUTING | Tag `v0.1.0`. Release artifacts smoke-tested. Publish PR merges clean | 2 d |
| M10 | Phase 1 gate run | Golden set at 45+ questions, eval harness, full Phase 1 gate | Gate table in [14](14-benchmark-eval.md) all PASS or triaged | 3 d |
| M11 | Quality pass | Injection filter v0, quarantine ops, session dedup, trust metadata surfacing | Filter rule tests. Quarantine release flow works. Failures −49% vs M4 baseline measured on the golden set | 4 d |
| M12 | Phase 3 optional | Embedding feature, binary-quantized vectors, RRF hybrid, sync jobs | Hybrid improves hit@3 on the golden set at p95 < 400 ms. Feature-off build unchanged | 5 d |

Total to the Phase 1 gate (M0–M10): about 27 working days. Phases 2 and 3 add about 9 to 12 more.

## Definition of done

A milestone is done when:

1. All acceptance criteria pass on the main branch, not on a feature branch.
2. The relevant guide files ([05](05-architecture.md) to [09](09-security-implementation.md)) still match the code. Divergence is a bug in the docs. Fix it in the same PR.
3. CI is green: fmt, clippy, tests on three OS targets, MSRV, features, deny, coverage, docs.
4. No new dependency without the [10](10-dependency-audit.md) checklist.

## Explicit non-goals per phase

| Phase | Not building |
|---|---|
| 1 | Code Mode, federation, HTML crawl adapter, private-source auth, TypeScript symbols |
| 2 | Web UI, hosted service, multi-user profiles |
| 3 | Alternative index backends, rerankers, hosted federation |
| 4 | Anything beyond the sandbox contract acceptance criteria |

The HTML crawl adapter stays last-resort-only. The Phase 1 corpus comes from llms.txt and git, which are publisher-sanctioned or version-exact paths (research: architecture.md §L1).
